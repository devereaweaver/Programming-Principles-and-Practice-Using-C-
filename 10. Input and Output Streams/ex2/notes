Reading type format:

(day hour temp)
	- day from 1 - 31
	- hour from 0 - 23
	- temp from -200 - +200

example: (3 4 9.7) == 3rd day of month at 4am the temperature was 9.7 degrees F.

struct Reading 
{
	int day;
	int hour;
	double temperature;
};

=======================================================================
Subroutine 1: subroutine creates an ofstream object and output file 
	- prompt user for name of output file 
	- create ofstream object "connecting" to the output file 
	- test ofstream
	- if error, throw error and GTFOT
	- if successful:
		- prompt user for day number & store in a string/int?
		- prompt user for hour number & store in a string/int?
		- prompt user for temperature & store in a string/double?
		- write the variables to file using the specified Reading format
		- continue until user exits (specify value to exit subroutine) 	
	- return to control to main
