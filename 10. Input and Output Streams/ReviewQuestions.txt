1) When dealing with input and output devices, most modern computer systems utilize device drivers that can be used to generalize the input/output.

2) An istream creates an input stream that is "attached" to a particular file. It allows the computer to read a stream of sequential bytes. 

3) An ostream create an output stream that is "attached" to a particualr file. It allows the computer to write a stream of sequential bytes. 

4) A file is a sequence of bytes that are used to represent data. 

5) A file format is a specification that tells the computer/user how to interpret the sequence of bytes that is a file. 

6) Keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer?

7) The four steps to reading a file are:
	1. Create an istream object 
	2. "Connect" the istream object to the file 
	3. Do whatever processing
	4. Close the file

8) The four steps to writing a file are: 
		1. Create an ostream object
		2. "Connect" the ostream object to the output file 
		3. Do whatever processing 
		4. Close file	

9) Name and define the four stream states. 
	1. good() - occurs when the file read/write operation was successful 
	2. eof() - stream has reached the EOF with no issues 
	3. fail() - an error occured when reading the file stream, not fatal
	4. bad() - very bad error occured, fatal. GTFOH of here. 

10) Come back and do this one

11) Input is usually more difficult than ouptut because you typically cannot control what the user will input. It can lead to unpredictable input which is hard to handle

12) I'm not entirely sure, I feel as though input is infinitely more difficult that output. However, output can be difficult in that you have to figure out how to 
   format the output, maybe?

13) We often want to separate input and ouput from computation because these type of functions should not "hardwire" messages in them. 

14) The clear() member function for the istream type is mostly used to clear the state of the error state flag
